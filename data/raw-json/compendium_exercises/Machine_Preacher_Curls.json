  "instructions": [
    "Sit down on the Preacher Curl Machine and select the weight.",
    "Place the back of your upper arms (your triceps) on the preacher pad provided and grab the handles using an underhand grip (palms facing up). Tip: Make sure that when you place the arms on the pad you keep the elbows in. This will be your starting position.",
    "Now lift the handles as you exhale and you contract the biceps. At the top of the position make sure that you hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Only the forearms should move. The upper arms should remain stationary and on the pad at all times.",
    "Lower the handles slowly back to the starting position as you inhale.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
