  "description": "Dumbbell fly on incline bench, opening arms wide to stretch and contract upper chest.",
  "instructions": [
    "Hold a dumbbell in each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees.",
    "Extend your arms above you with a slight bend at the elbows. The palms of your hands should be facing each other (neutral grip). This will be your starting position.",
    "As you breathe in, start to slowly lower the arms to the side in a wide arc while keeping the arms extended and maintaining the slight bend at the elbows. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be out to your sides with the palms facing up.",
    "As you exhale, bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and squeezing your chest muscles. Tip: Keep in mind that the movement will only happen at the shoulder joint. There is no motion that happens at the elbow joint.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
