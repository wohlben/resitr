  "description": "Seated barbell finger curl with palms up, building forearm flexors and finger flexion strength by rolling the bar down to fingertips and curling it back up.",
  "instructions": [
    "Hold a barbell with both hands and your palms facing up; hands spaced about shoulder width.",
    "Sit down on a flat bench. Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart.",
    "Lean forward and place your forearms on top of your upper thighs with your palms up. Your wrists should be hanging over your knees. This will be your starting position.",
    "Lower the bar as far as possible by extending the fingers. Allowing the bar to roll down the hands, catch the bar with the final joint in the fingers.",
    "Now curl bar up as high as possible by closing your hands while exhaling. Hold the contraction at the top."
