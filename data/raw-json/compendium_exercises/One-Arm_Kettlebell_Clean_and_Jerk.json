    "Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright.",
    "Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum. As you do so, press the kettlebell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight.",

    "Keeping the weight overhead, return to a standing position. Lower the weight to the floor to perform the next repetition."
