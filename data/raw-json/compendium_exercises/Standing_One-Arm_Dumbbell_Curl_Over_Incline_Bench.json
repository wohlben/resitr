    "Stand on the back side of an incline bench as if you were going to be a spotter for someone. Have a dumbbell in one hand and rest it across the incline bench with a supinated (palms up) grip.",

    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
    "Switch arms while performing this exercise."
