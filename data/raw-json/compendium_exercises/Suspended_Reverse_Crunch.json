  "instructions": [
    "Secure a set of suspension straps with the handles hanging about a foot off of the ground. Move yourself into a pushup plank position facing away from the rack.",
    "Place your feet into the handles. You should maintain a straight posture, not allowing the hips to sag. This will be your starting position.",
    "Begin the movement by flexing the knees and hips, drawing the knees to your torso. As you do so, anteriorly tilt your pelvis, allowing your spine to flex.",
    "At the top of the controlled motion, return to the starting position."
