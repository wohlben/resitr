  "instructions": [
    "Begin kneeling on the floor with a barbell racked across the back of your shoulders, or you can use your body weight for this exercise. This can be done inside of a power rack to make unracking easier.",
    "Sit back with your hips until your glutes touch your feet, keeping your head and chest up.",
    "Explode up with your hips, generating enough power to land with your feet flat on the floor.",
    "Continue with the squat by driving through your heels and extending the knees to come to a standing position."
