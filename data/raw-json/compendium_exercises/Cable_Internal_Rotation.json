  "instructions": [
    "Adjust the cable to the same height as your elbow. Stand with your right side to the cable a couple of feet away.",
    "Grasp the handle with your right hand, and keep your elbow pressed firmly to your side. We recommend you hold a pad or foam roll in place with your elbow to keep it firmly in position.",
    "With your upper arm in position, your elbow should be flexed to 90 degrees with your hand rotated out away from your torso. This will be your starting position.",
    "Execute the movement by rotating your arm in a forehand motion across your body, keeping your elbow in place and maintaining the 90-degree angle.",
    "Return slowly to the starting position.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm."
