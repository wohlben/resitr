  "description": "Standing overhead barbell triceps extension, pressing bar overhead by extending elbows.",
  "instructions": [
    "To begin, stand up holding a barbell or e-z bar using a pronated grip (palms facing forward) with your hands closer than shoulder width apart from each other. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart.",
    "Now elevate the barbell above your head until your arms are fully extended. Keep your elbows in. This will be your starting position.",
    "Keeping your upper arms close to your head and elbows in, perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.",
    "Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the barbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
