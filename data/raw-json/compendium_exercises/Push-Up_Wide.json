    "With your hands wide apart, support your body on your toes and hands in a plank position. Your elbows should be extended and your body straight. Do not allow your hips to sag. This will be your starting position.",
    "To begin, allow the elbows to flex, lowering your chest to the floor as you inhale.",
    "Using your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position by extending the elbows. Exhale as you perform this step.",
    "After pausing at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions."
