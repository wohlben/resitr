  "instructions": [
    "Move into a prone position on the floor, supporting your weight on your hands and toes.",
    "Your arms should be fully extended with the hands around shoulder width. Keep your body straight throughout the movement. This will be your starting position.",
    "Descend by flexing at the elbow, lowering your chest toward the ground.",
    "At the bottom, reverse the motion by pushing yourself up through elbow extension as quickly as possible until you are air borne. Aim to \"jump\" 12-18 inches to one side.",
    "As you accelerate up, move your outside foot away from your direction of travel. Leaving the ground, shift your body about 30 degrees for the next repetition.",
    "Return to the starting position and repeat the exercise, working all the way around until you are back where you started."
