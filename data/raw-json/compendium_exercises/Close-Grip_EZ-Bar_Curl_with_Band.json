  "instructions": [
    "Attach a band to each end of the bar. Take the bar, placing a foot on the middle of the band. Stand upright with a narrow, supinated grip on the EZ bar. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.",
    "While keeping the upper arms in place, flex the elbows to execute the curl. Exhale as the weight is lifted.",
    "Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.",
    "Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
