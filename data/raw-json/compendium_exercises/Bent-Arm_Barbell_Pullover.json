    "Lie on a flat bench with a barbell using a shoulder grip width.",
    "Hold the bar straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. This will be your starting position.",
    "While keeping your arms in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.",
    "At that point, bring the barbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.",
    "Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions."
