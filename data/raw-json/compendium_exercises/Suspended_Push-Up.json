  "instructions": [
    "Anchor your suspension straps securely to the top of a rack or other object.",
    "Leaning into the straps, take a handle in each hand and move into a push-up plank position. You should be as close to parallel to the ground as you can manage with your arms fully extended, maintaining good posture.",
    "Maintaining a straight, rigid torso, descend slowly by allowing the elbows to flex.",
    "Continue until your elbows break 90 degrees, pausing before you extend to return to the starting position."
