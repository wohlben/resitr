    "Grab a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing forward) and get your elbows close to your torso and back. This will be your starting position.",
    "As you exhale, curl the bar up while keeping the elbows to the back as you \"Drag\" the bar up by keeping it in contact with your torso. Tip: As you can see, you will not be keeping the elbows pinned to your sides, but instead you will be bringing them back. Also, do not lift your shoulders.",
    "Slowly go back to the starting position as you keep the bar in contact with the torso at all times.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
