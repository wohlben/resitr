  "description": "Cable hammer curls with rope attachment targeting biceps and forearms through neutral-grip elbow flexion under constant tension",
  "instructions": [
    "Attach a rope attachment to a low pulley and stand facing the machine about 12 inches away from it.",
    "Grasp the rope with a neutral (palms-in) grip and stand straight up keeping the natural arch of the back and your torso stationary.",
    "Put your elbows in by your side and keep them there stationary during the entire movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move; not your upper arms. This will be your starting position.",
    "Using your biceps, pull your arms up as you exhale until your biceps touch your forearms. Tip: Remember to keep the elbows in and your upper arms stationary.",
    "After a 1 second contraction where you squeeze your biceps, slowly start to bring the weight back to the original position.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
