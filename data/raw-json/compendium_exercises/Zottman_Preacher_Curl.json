    "Grab a dumbbell in each hand and place your upper arms on top of the preacher bench. The dumbbells should be held with palms facing up (supinated grip) at the bottom position with arms extended. This will be your starting position.",
    "As you exhale, curl the dumbbells up while keeping the palms facing up (supinated) until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder height.",
    "Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position.",
    "Now rotate your wrists at the top so that the palms of the hands are facing down (pronated grip).",
    "As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells with the pronated grip until your upper arms are extended and your biceps are fully stretched.",
    "At the bottom, rotate your wrists back to the supinated (palms up) position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
