  "description": "Leg extension using resistance band, extending leg against band resistance to isolate quadriceps.",
  "instructions": [
    "Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point behind you at floor level.",
    "Sit on a chair or bench and loop the band around one ankle. The band should be behind you, creating resistance when you extend your leg forward.",
    "Position yourself so that your knee is at a 90-degree angle when starting. Hold onto the sides of the chair for stability. This will be your starting position.",
    "Using your quadriceps, extend your leg forward until it is straight, exhaling as you perform this motion. Keep the rest of your body stationary.",
    "Pause briefly at the fully extended position, squeezing your quadriceps.",
    "Slowly return your leg to the starting position as you inhale, maintaining control against the band resistance.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions, then switch legs."
