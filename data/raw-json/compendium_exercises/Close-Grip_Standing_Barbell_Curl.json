  "instructions": [
    "Hold a barbell with both hands, palms up and a few inches apart.",
    "Stand with your torso straight and your head up. Your feet should be about shoulder width and your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will keep your upper arms and elbows stationary throughout the movement.",
    "Curl the bar up in a semicircular motion until the forearms touch your biceps. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and contract your biceps hard for a second at the top. Tip: Avoid bending the back or using swinging motions as you lift the weight. Only the forearms should move.",
    "Slowly go back down to the starting position as you inhale.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
