    "Begin standing with a dumbbell in each hand with your feet shoulder width apart.",
    "Lower the weights to the floor by flexing at the hips and knees, pushing your hips back until the dumbbells reach the floor. This will be your starting position.",
    "To initiate the movement, violently jump upward by extending the hips, knees, and ankles to acclerate the weights upward. Maintaining a neutral grip on the dumbbells, keep the arms straight until full extension is reached.",
    "After full extension, rebend the hips and knees to receive the weight in a squat position. Allow the arms to bend, guiding the dumbbells to your shoulders.",
    "Upon receiving the weight in the squat position, extend the hips and knees to finish in a standing position with the weights on your shoulders."
